# Python-Deep-Learning
Here I have published three projects using real data. 
These projects use Deep Learning models and Tensor Flow to solve real world problems!
Through these project I have gained skills such as data preprocessing, data analysis and data engineering.
These skills are applied to prepare the data set for deep learning models. 
I then use deep learning techniques to train my model and test in on a portion of the data. 
The resulting models are used to predict new data entries. 
Such techniques can be applied to a range of real life situations such as bank loans, cancer recognition and house pricing in my projects.
The data files used to run the code are not inlcuded due to data file restrictions.
Any comments are greatly appreciated!
